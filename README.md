# ngmDevWorkflow
Development workflow and pilot for djagno-angular xlsforms web application framework

## Use Case
A system is required that enables a System Administrator (SA) to deploy an application framework for a reporting workflow. The system should enable registered users to be assigned to groups that the administrator can create and manage. The ability to add sub-groups is also required. Within these groups, the SA should then be able to upload an [XLSForm] that generates into [Django models] and HTML5 forms that alert the user and requires submission.

A basic user should be able to register to existing groups, of which the group focal point will provide clearance before access is provided. Once registered, the user should be able to view and update their profile which will include a history feed. The user will also have access to reports required in order to add, edit and delete submissions.

From the admin interface, the SA should be able to view the results of submissions in tabluar and graphic form. The table will contain each entry including any link. The graphic format will summarise indicators and aggregate information.

This task will be broken into 4 main objectives;


[XLSForm]: http://xlsform.org/
[Django models]: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/topics/db/models/
